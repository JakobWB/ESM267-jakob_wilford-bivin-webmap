>The map below displays historical nightlight data from the **Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Line-Scan System (OLS)**. The data has been clipped to the extent of the state of **North Dakota**, in order to illustrate how an oil and gas boom can rapidly alter development. 
>>The currently selected layers are the nightlight data from 1992 and the overlaid percent change layer, which represents the change in irradiance at the kilometer level from 1992 to 2013. The color ramp goes from light pink (little to no change) to dark red (significant change).

> I noticed this trend in North Dakota while looking at nightlight data for the entirety of the United States. I investigated and found that several developments, all related to fossil fuel production, were responsible:
>- The Parshall Oil Field, part of the Bakken Formation, was discovered in 2006. Its production peaked in 2012.
>
>- Technological improvements, especially advancements in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling made previously unavailable deposits exploitable.
>
>- Williston, ND, which reportedly serves as the "Hub City" for activity surrounding the Bakken formation showed the following population change:
>	- 1992: 13,193
>	- 2013: 21,950
>	- 2018: 27,096
